# Calculator-Layout-Challenge
Auto Layout Challenge by Angela Yu

#This is my first challenge here in GitHub. I'm practicing all about Stack Views and trying to put it in together with my recent Git knowledge.

#In this challenge, the only thing I have to do is to make the calculator's UI fit in the iPhone 11 screen when we set it to landscape.
